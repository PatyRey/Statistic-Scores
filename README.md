# Computational-Statistics
This Java program will implement a 2d array to create a table using the data from a text file. The program will tokenize the information, creating a string array for the dates and an int array with the scores.

The score data will be used to calculate the Mean score for each day and the Standard Deviation in scores for each day.

Then the program  will also compute the difference between means for each day.
